# Personal-Site
This is my own personal site, built with love, hand coded from scratch. It may be a poop, you've been warned
I'll try and keep this updated with changes as I learn and go about this. I am using Jeckyll for site development
which I've never used before and seems a little confusing right now, will read up and return back
